      <div class="container" id="backgroundinfo">Coming from a background in events and the music industry, my role has always been promoting online presece, along with all the other aspects of running events. I had a long-standing involvement at a weekly event at Sheffield University, building it over twenty years. I also co-founded First Word Records, an independent label which sold music, both physically and digitally, for over fifteen years. 

        This background in the music industry has allowed the opportunity to learn whilst working on real life projects. This has involved everything from working with ticketing APIs and building mySQL web-stores, to setting up and designing WordPress sites which enable teams to add content as required. 
        
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        As the complexity and impact of social media and content platforms have greatly expanded over the years, my knowledge of them has increased in line.
        
        I have been very privileged to work with both teams and individuals bringing the technologies they require into existence. This has meant bridging the gap between marketers, project coordinators, promoters, designers and artists to clearly communicate what is possible and how systems work. 
        
        As my reputation and skills as web developer have grown, I have been able to expand outside of my initial industry (the music industry) and build sites for other sectors. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        While many skills have been transferable, working within different industries has been an invaluable experience.
        
        In recent months I have worked independently to fill in my gaps of knowledge within coding. I now feel I have reached a point where specialising in a language or framework would be the next step.
